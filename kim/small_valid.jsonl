I was released from the hospital after about a month and returned home to continue recovering with my family.After months of recovery and PT for my femur surgery, I am just now beginning to get back on my feet, and I am planning on returning to work as a professor at the end of next month. During my last neurological examination, the CT scan found that my third ventricle has grown from 4 mm to 6 mm. This worries me tremendously since the research I have done online signifies that this may indicate hydrocephalus (attached is the radiologist findings).My question to you is, can my third ventricle enlarging be anything other than hydrocephalus? Is this a common occurrence after a traumatic SAH due to an accident? If it is indeed hydrocephalus, is the only treatment a shunt? Is there a less invasive treatment? I am really scared beyond words, and I am hoping that I do not end up with hydrocephalus. What is the usual timeline for the hydrocephalus to develop after SAH? I will be sure to get a full check-up once I see my neurologist in a few weeks, but I just cannot wait any longer for an answer. Thank you for your time."}, {"role": "Chatbot", "content": "Hi.

Your electrophoresis report is suggestive of HbE (attachment removed to protect patient identity). It is a case of a mild form of hemolytic anemia. In that case, the ferritin level might not be raised. Along with low ferritin, your red blood cells count is also low. Usually, in hemoglobinopathy, red blood cells count is high. So your wife\\s complete diagnosis is HbE trait with secondary iron deficiency anemia. So you can give your wife Iron tablets to raise the hemoglobin level and ferritin level. HbE is not a major hemolytic disease, so you need not worry about your child or future child although your child acquires HbE trait. HbE trait patient lives a normal life. I strongly recommend you to get investigated for hemoglobinopathy by electrophoresis because if you have trait then your child can acquire HbE disease.

Firstly, let me tell you that sonography is not always suggestive of adenomyosis. It cannot diagnose it. For diagnosis, you have to send biopsy of the uterus. In adenomyosis there is pain before, during and after menses. There is also focal and diffuse type of adenomyosis. Whatever you read on the internet is about diffuse or generalized adenomyosis. A few things on focal adenomyosis are available because most of the time it goes undiagnosed or has very mild symptoms that do not hamper routine. So, just focus on the present and start trying for pregnancy. In fact, if you get pregnant and pregnancy goes up to term or near term, then there is a chance of cure from adenomyosis theoretically. If you do not have the symptoms of clear adenomyosis, then there is a chance that it is not adenomyosis. So, do not worry and take chance for a year.

First of all, I want to tell you that beard growth is related to your hormones, mainly testosterone. Sometimes in some men, it took longer to grow a beard. You are still in your teen years. So do not worry and wait for some more years because as you will grow older, you will get more facial hair. The beard growth also depends on genetics too, so watch out your father and uncles too for their growth. Because some men get full facial hair in the late twenties. There is no food, supplement, or vitamin to increase the beard. So beware of these kinds of ads or supplements. Some people use testosterone gels or testosterone pills to increase their beard, but in the long run, these things have potential side effects. My suggestion to you is wait for some more years because you already have some facial hair and they will increase with time, so you do not have to worry. After some years, if you do not get as many hairs as you want, then you can opt-out for facial hair transplant. But do not do it so early because you are too young and you will get your beard to grow naturally after some years. I hope this helps. Failure of gonads or testes in men.

Herpes viruses are of many types and can spread through skin contact also. Here I think you are concerned with genital herpes virus which causes STD.

No, there is no vaccine available for herpes. But you must get hepatitis B vaccination done as it is a fatal disease. 4. If you are using lubricated condoms then no need to use a lubricant unless your partner is not comfortable without a lubricant. 5. Anal sex is usually not advisable as it can cause intense pain and injury inside your partner\\s anus and not safe for her.

Ideally, filling procedures do not work for gum recession problems but only for decay or abrasions close to the gum lines.

So initially, subjects the patients to minor tests like TMT (treadmill test) or stress echo or stress thallium. If either of the tests is abnormal then it is better to subject to the patient to angiography. Now, in our case, since her TMT is positive, it is better to subject her for angiography. There is no harm in having stress echo, but suppose it is positive then certainly she will need angiography. But if it is negative then we can again land up in a dilemma of which test to be relied upon. Then she will need some more tests like stress or CT coronary angiography to prove TMT was negative. So it is better to get an angiography done and clear all our doubts. There is sufficient evidence of abnormalities and angiography is a gold standard test. Also, discuss how strongly was TMT positive. If it is strongly positive then nothing to think and go ahead with angiography and if it is mild positive then you may think of stress echo.

Bright green color stool could be due to the presence of bile in stool. During a colonoscopy, you were given laxatives that might have disturbed your intestinal flora that is responsible for the yellowcolor of the stool. Also, stool must have passed rapidly through the gut. Other causes could be: 1. Fat rich diet will increase the release of bile pigments and if it moves rapidly, your stool will be green. It occurs during a period of stress or infections. 2. Rarely diet rich in green leafy vegetables can cause green color stools, if malabsorption ensues or due to not chewing properly. 3. If you have any other symptoms like abdominal pain, bloating, nausea, vomiting or green stools, do not stop within the next 12 to 14 hours. Then I would suggest you consult your doctor. You can take probiotics to build up your intestinal flora. "}]}

There is McDonalds criteria for imaging in MS and if the radiologist did not mention any findings which are under these criteria then it is unlikely to be MS from this scan.

There are some reasons for fresh blood in stools, with stools, before or after stools other than menstrual blood.First of all, it may be hemorrhoids. You may have felt some dilated small lesions on the anal opening before or after passing stools ( if this was bleeding hemorrhoid). It is due to a disease named portal hypertension and you need to follow it up and it will settle down with treatment. Your general surgeon is the person to decide the stage of hemorrhoids and treatment goes accordingly. He may do proctoscopy, colonoscopy or digital rectal examination. The other cause is anal fissure bleed. When stools get hard due to constipation and when patient forcibly defecates, it causes a breach in the mucosal lining of the rectum and anus and it bleeds in the form of fresh blood. Lactulose syrup, whole grain foods, dietary fiber supplements, plenty of fluids and a good physical activity will help improve this condition. But it may also need treatment with antibiotics to avoid severe infection. General surgeon consultation for a physical examination is my suggestion. Last but not least is the cancerous growth. It is serious but less likely in your case. But if you have a family history of colon cancer, have a change in bowel habits, lost weight, loss in appetite, constipation or diarrhea, You may be having cancer. A general surgeon will diagnose with colonoscopy and barium tests through radiologic studies. Final suggestion - avoid constipation, keep a good physical activity, avoid fast foods, processed meats, low fiber diet, and soft  .

Puffy swollen gums are a sign of periodontal disease. The cause of the periodontal disease is microbial deposits on the teeth (dental plaque). The plaque when mineralized become tartar (calculus). The calculus, in turn, attracts more plaque, and the disease process continues. At later stages, it may lead to bone loss and mobility of the teeth. I would suggest you to please visit your dentist and get your teeth cleaned, your dentist will be able to assess the stage of periodontal disease and if required will refer you to a periodontist. Get your oral health check-up done every six months so that any changes in the oral cavity can be treated in the initial stages. Deposits on teeth. Clinical examination and IOPA. Scaling and root planing, if it has reached the advanced stage then further periodontal treatment. Proper brushing of teeth and regular check-up. "}]}

Because I liked the effect of Retinol, I switched to Retin-A Micro (0.1 %) while exfoliating every single day. I did this for about a year.
