I was released from the hospital after about a month and returned home to continue recovering with my family.After months of recovery and PT for my femur surgery, I am just now beginning to get back on my feet, and I am planning on returning to work as a professor at the end of next month. During my last neurological examination, the CT scan found that my third ventricle has grown from 4 mm to 6 mm. This worries me tremendously since the research I have done online signifies that this may indicate hydrocephalus (attached is the radiologist findings).My question to you is, can my third ventricle enlarging be anything other than hydrocephalus? Is this a common occurrence after a traumatic SAH due to an accident? If it is indeed hydrocephalus, is the only treatment a shunt? Is there a less invasive treatment? I am really scared beyond words, and I am hoping that I do not end up with hydrocephalus. What is the usual timeline for the hydrocephalus to develop after SAH? I will be sure to get a full check-up once I see my neurologist in a few weeks, but I just cannot wait any longer for an answer. Thank you for your time."}, {"role": "Chatbot", "content": "Hi.

Your electrophoresis report is suggestive of HbE (attachment removed to protect patient identity). It is a case of a mild form of hemolytic anemia. In that case, the ferritin level might not be raised. Along with low ferritin, your red blood cells count is also low. Usually, in hemoglobinopathy, red blood cells count is high. So your wife\\s complete diagnosis is HbE trait with secondary iron deficiency anemia. So you can give your wife Iron tablets to raise the hemoglobin level and ferritin level. HbE is not a major hemolytic disease, so you need not worry about your child or future child although your child acquires HbE trait. HbE trait patient lives a normal life. I strongly recommend you to get investigated for hemoglobinopathy by electrophoresis because if you have trait then your child can acquire HbE disease.

Firstly, let me tell you that sonography is not always suggestive of adenomyosis. It cannot diagnose it. For diagnosis, you have to send biopsy of the uterus. In adenomyosis there is pain before, during and after menses. There is also focal and diffuse type of adenomyosis. Whatever you read on the internet is about diffuse or generalized adenomyosis. A few things on focal adenomyosis are available because most of the time it goes undiagnosed or has very mild symptoms that do not hamper routine. So, just focus on the present and start trying for pregnancy. In fact, if you get pregnant and pregnancy goes up to term or near term, then there is a chance of cure from adenomyosis theoretically. If you do not have the symptoms of clear adenomyosis, then there is a chance that it is not adenomyosis. So, do not worry and take chance for a year.

First of all, I want to tell you that beard growth is related to your hormones, mainly testosterone. Sometimes in some men, it took longer to grow a beard. You are still in your teen years. So do not worry and wait for some more years because as you will grow older, you will get more facial hair. The beard growth also depends on genetics too, so watch out your father and uncles too for their growth. Because some men get full facial hair in the late twenties. There is no food, supplement, or vitamin to increase the beard. So beware of these kinds of ads or supplements. Some people use testosterone gels or testosterone pills to increase their beard, but in the long run, these things have potential side effects. My suggestion to you is wait for some more years because you already have some facial hair and they will increase with time, so you do not have to worry. After some years, if you do not get as many hairs as you want, then you can opt-out for facial hair transplant. But do not do it so early because you are too young and you will get your beard to grow naturally after some years. I hope this helps. Failure of gonads or testes in men.

Herpes viruses are of many types and can spread through skin contact also. Here I think you are concerned with genital herpes virus which causes STD.

No, there is no vaccine available for herpes. But you must get hepatitis B vaccination done as it is a fatal disease. 4. If you are using lubricated condoms then no need to use a lubricant unless your partner is not comfortable without a lubricant. 5. Anal sex is usually not advisable as it can cause intense pain and injury inside your partner\\s anus and not safe for her.

Ideally, filling procedures do not work for gum recession problems but only for decay or abrasions close to the gum lines.

So initially, subjects the patients to minor tests like TMT (treadmill test) or stress echo or stress thallium. If either of the tests is abnormal then it is better to subject to the patient to angiography. Now, in our case, since her TMT is positive, it is better to subject her for angiography. There is no harm in having stress echo, but suppose it is positive then certainly she will need angiography. But if it is negative then we can again land up in a dilemma of which test to be relied upon. Then she will need some more tests like stress or CT coronary angiography to prove TMT was negative. So it is better to get an angiography done and clear all our doubts. There is sufficient evidence of abnormalities and angiography is a gold standard test. Also, discuss how strongly was TMT positive. If it is strongly positive then nothing to think and go ahead with angiography and if it is mild positive then you may think of stress echo.

Bright green color stool could be due to the presence of bile in stool. During a colonoscopy, you were given laxatives that might have disturbed your intestinal flora that is responsible for the yellowcolor of the stool. Also, stool must have passed rapidly through the gut. Other causes could be: 1. Fat rich diet will increase the release of bile pigments and if it moves rapidly, your stool will be green. It occurs during a period of stress or infections. 2. Rarely diet rich in green leafy vegetables can cause green color stools, if malabsorption ensues or due to not chewing properly. 3. If you have any other symptoms like abdominal pain, bloating, nausea, vomiting or green stools, do not stop within the next 12 to 14 hours. Then I would suggest you consult your doctor. You can take probiotics to build up your intestinal flora. "}]}

There is McDonalds criteria for imaging in MS and if the radiologist did not mention any findings which are under these criteria then it is unlikely to be MS from this scan.

There are some reasons for fresh blood in stools, with stools, before or after stools other than menstrual blood.First of all, it may be hemorrhoids. You may have felt some dilated small lesions on the anal opening before or after passing stools ( if this was bleeding hemorrhoid). It is due to a disease named portal hypertension and you need to follow it up and it will settle down with treatment. Your general surgeon is the person to decide the stage of hemorrhoids and treatment goes accordingly. He may do proctoscopy, colonoscopy or digital rectal examination. The other cause is anal fissure bleed. When stools get hard due to constipation and when patient forcibly defecates, it causes a breach in the mucosal lining of the rectum and anus and it bleeds in the form of fresh blood. Lactulose syrup, whole grain foods, dietary fiber supplements, plenty of fluids and a good physical activity will help improve this condition. But it may also need treatment with antibiotics to avoid severe infection. General surgeon consultation for a physical examination is my suggestion. Last but not least is the cancerous growth. It is serious but less likely in your case. But if you have a family history of colon cancer, have a change in bowel habits, lost weight, loss in appetite, constipation or diarrhea, You may be having cancer. A general surgeon will diagnose with colonoscopy and barium tests through radiologic studies. Final suggestion - avoid constipation, keep a good physical activity, avoid fast foods, processed meats, low fiber diet, and soft  .

Puffy swollen gums are a sign of periodontal disease. The cause of the periodontal disease is microbial deposits on the teeth (dental plaque). The plaque when mineralized become tartar (calculus). The calculus, in turn, attracts more plaque, and the disease process continues. At later stages, it may lead to bone loss and mobility of the teeth. I would suggest you to please visit your dentist and get your teeth cleaned, your dentist will be able to assess the stage of periodontal disease and if required will refer you to a periodontist. Get your oral health check-up done every six months so that any changes in the oral cavity can be treated in the initial stages. Deposits on teeth. Clinical examination and IOPA. Scaling and root planing, if it has reached the advanced stage then further periodontal treatment. Proper brushing of teeth and regular check-up. "}]}

Blood in urine after renal colic suggests stone may have reached the lower end of kidney tube (ureter) and may pass soon. However, it is best to confirm it has passed by getting an ultrasound done. Flomax (Tamsulosin) helps dilate lower end of the ureter and so may help stone to pass. You may take painkiller or antispasmodic for pain. Increased fluid intake helps. If the stone is of pure uric acid, taking citrus juices or taking potassium citrate syrup may dissolve the stone. I suggest, if bleeding continues, or there is pain or fever, or you have difficulty emptying your bladder, go see your doctor. Later, a metabolic workup of your 24-hour urine collection may be needed to see why you form so many stones. For more information consult a urologist online "}]}

If there is no relief even after seven days, better get your chest X-ray done from your family doctor and get treated accordingly. Usually smoking for five years at this age does not cause lung cancer but you should stop smoking. Smokers\\ cough because of bronchitis is very common.

The following has started after I lost a lot of weight.For the last 9 months, I have had to sleep sitting up in a chair and leaning to my left side. If I lie down to sleep horizontally, or remain sitting up but tilting even slightly backward, or if I slip down on to my back on the chair while asleep, my heart begins to get faster and faster. I feel no pain and it does not wake me up. That is the problem, I sleep through it until I wake up with the need of going to the bathroom. I suspect these episodes last for hours with my heart going dangerously fast. These are not palpitations.When I wake up, my heart is often racing, and I have to take deep breaths for a couple of minutes to get enough oxygen inside me for the heart to return to its normal beat. It all started very suddenly, not progressive. For all these months I have been scared by the prospect of having to go to sleep and leave it as long as possible before trying, just praying that I can get through the night keeping myself upright and with a reasonably clear nose. If I can do that, I can usually make it through reasonably fine, but this is the exception rather than the rule.Body position seems to be one key factor, clear nose another, but the first always overrides the latter in importance. I recently had to make a 6 day 1500 mile dash drive and slept every night upright in the car seat right next to an open window. I had no problems at all during those 5 nights. A cardiologist has run tests and told me there is nothing abnormal with my heart's muscle or function.I rented an automatic CPAP machine for 4 months, but have now returned it. It does not do much of help, but its data shows no continuous waking such as might happen with obstructive sleep apnea. It does, however, show that I go into periods of shallow breathing while asleep. The only other suggestion that I have had is that this might be some form of central sleep apnea and therefore perhaps more neurologically based. The company that rented me the CPAP machine say that a BIPAP machine might be better, as it will force me to breathe, but I would really like a more expert opinion before going down that extremely expensive road.Do you know any other people who have had similar symptoms and experiences, and if so, what was the cause and how was it treated?

If you had intercourse around 10th to 17th day of your cycle, and if you have a regular menstrual cycle, then the possibility of conception increases with each day within that period when the condom has broken. In this situation, you can take an emergency pill within 72 hours of sexual intercourse to avoid pregnancy. Sperms can stay alive in the vaginal tract for up to seven days whereas the egg remains available for fertilization for 24 hours. In conception, you have to wait for at least a week to get a positive pregnancy test with urine dipstick. Serum beta hCG can be detected earlier, but you have to wait for a few days. You do not need to go to a doctor. Just repeat the urine pregnancy test after two weeks or get a blood pregnancy test done. "}]}

To locate PC muscle, it is located in the perineum area behind the scrotum and in front of the anus. It is deep to skin and soft tissue, and urethra passes through this muscle. Hence contraction of this muscle helps to delay ejaculation by compressing urethra. The exercises for the PC muscles includes sitting with a straight back, both hands on lap. Squeeze in the anus as if trying to hold bowel while defecating. Hold and count to 10 and then slowly release the muscle. Do this for 6 to 10 times per sitting. Every day you can have 4 to 5 such sittings. While passing urine, what you can do is hold urine for 1 to 2 seconds, then, pass it, then again hold.

{"messages": [{"role": "User", "content": "Hi doctor,Approximately six weeks ago, I got niggling wisdom teeth pain. The left top and bottom wisdom teeth were breaking through the gums. I got sudden pain which was severe in intensity around the back of my mouth and the lower left side. It got aggravated especially on chewing and radiating to the next tooth and along the jaw. The dentist suggested a wait and watch for few days. The next day when the wisdom tooth started to come out, the pain got severely worse over the jaw and the temporomandibular joint. I was unable to tolerate. I cannot even rest my top and bottom teeth together. I got complete numbness on the left side of the chin and lower lip and difficulty in opening my mouth for more than one or two fingers. I could not sleep and felt ill because of the pain. On the X-ray, the wisdom tooth is horizontally impacted, and there were no signs of infection or abscess. The tooth next to the wisdom has a large old filling nearing the pulp. But there are no signs of anything wrong with it on an X-ray. The dentists could not find whether it was the pressure of the impacted tooth on the next tooth or problem with the filled tooth. So, I was just given antibiotics. By the end of the antibiotics, it was slightly better, but I still felt ill. Again, the dentist decided to wait and watch.  As I felt iller than the previous time, I was given another course of different antibiotics. The pain was reduced. But I still have numbness in the chin. However, most of the numbness on the lip has resolved.A constant cramp sensation along the bottom of my jaw and temporomandibular joint with the discomfort temporarily ease with rubbing or stretching or massage. I regained most of my mouth opening back, but it is uncomfortable to open and hold in that position. I also think the jaw discomfort and cramping are worse on the days when I have to talk more. The wisdom tooth and the next tooth are still mildly tender. I can eat soft foods comfortably, but I get pain in the two teeth and the gum surrounding the wisdom tooth on eating hard foods like a raw carrot. The pain will last up to an hour or more. I have never had any hot or cold sensitivity or nasty taste in my mouth. The dentist I saw thinks that it is because of the nerves from the filled tooth and wants to do root canal treatment or extraction. How would this change any of the nerve or temporomandibular joint pain? I am worried that if the impacted tooth\\s pressure is causing the pain, then it will make no difference anyway.

Even a lower dose of caffeine can cause palpitations and there is no as such dose relationship with respect to palpitations. It may lead to all your symptoms. Also, anxiety or stress is usually an additional factor which may cause or worsen the palpitations. Usually, palpitations like these are usually benign and non-life-threatening although they may be troublesome. Considering your comorbidities, it is better to evaluate these, not just due to palpitations but also as screening cardiac test, and to rule out the possibility of cardiac arrhythmia. So, you should have a baseline ECG especially during palpitations and may need 24 hours Holter monitoring if not able to get ECG during palpitations. Also, you may alternatively use mobile-based rhythm monitors like Alivecor Kardia or other monitors. Also, you should get one echo done to look for the status of heart and its valve. So, try to reduce caffeine consumption as much as possible and see the response.  "}]}

My health problems started two years back, when I had a lot of stomach pains, though they went away quickly once I had a filling meal. After an endoscopy, the doctor observed a large axial hernia as well as moderately pronounced gastritis. I was prescribed PPI, and the problems went away for a while. The effects of the PPI seemed to diminish after a while as the pain returned during nights and while exercising. In the mornings, I suffered from severe heartburn and short-term breathing troubles possibly because stomach acid went into my lungs at night. Over time, I have been prescribed different PPIs like Pantoloc, Esomeprazole, and Pariet, and the dosage always increased.As the symptoms did not improve, the doctors recommended a surgery last year. Beginning of this year, I had a laparoscopic fundoplication. I could not swallow anything, not water or even my saliva, during the first five days after the surgery. The doctors suspected this was due to strong swelling, and I was able to start swallowing again after the sixth day. After the suggested diet phase, I was able to eat almost everything and was very happy about that.Since the end of last month, however, I have had strong symptoms again. I celebrated my birthday by drinking some alcohol the day before it started. The stomach pains, bloating, gurgling noises in my stomach, and most uncomfortably, pain in my lungs started again. The chest pains come mainly when I bend my upper body or when I turn in bed. My primary care doctor prescribed me 20 mg Pantoloc to take for a week, as she suspected gastritis. The symptoms were still present after a week, so the doctor who performed the surgery did another endoscopy. He determined it is a moderately pronounced gastritis and suggested three weeks of PPI therapy.As I was still concerned about the pain in my chest, I also went to a lung specialist, who diagnosed an inflammation of the bronchi, probably caused by the yearlong influence of the stomach acid. He prescribed a Cortisone inhaler, which I have been using for two weeks now. Also, I currently take 40 mg Nexium in the morning and try to take a light diet.

{"messages": [{"role": "User", "content": "Hi doctor,After deep brain stimulation surgery for generalized dystonia 18 months ago, I have developed mild startle myoclonus a fortnight later and was prescribed 0.5 mg Clonazepam. Since being on Clonazepam, I developed mild anxiety and my myoclonus continued to worsen. Now, I have violent full body jerks that cause me to fall over backwards every day. I am now on 1 mg Clonazepam in the morning and evening. After six months of Clonazepam and just after increasing my dose to 0.5 mg twice a day, I developed pressure of speech and the longer I have been on the drug the worse my myoclonus and anxiety has become. I am now in a vicious circle as the myoclonus episodes are so violent and I fall backwards heavily despite whatever I hold onto. I have become anxious at having an episode and the actual anxiety can trigger a myoclonus episode, although it also occurs when I feel safe such as sitting down, reading a book or chatting with friends.Six weeks ago, I was told to double the dose due to the high number of falls I was having during myoclonus episodes and since then I have developed mini-seizures and worsening of anxiety. My neurologist is referring me to a psychiatrist for CBT for anxiety and now believes anxiety is the likely cause of my myoclonus. I am happy to do this as I just want to overcome my fear of falling. My dystonia also is causing me to fall due to motor control problems with my legs. The behavior of my legs is very unpredictable, so without warning I regularly trip or my legs suddenly buckle, especially when tired or if I am on my feet for too long. Every drug I have been on since been diagnosed with dystonia has caused serious side effects, even at a low dose and I was told by one of the neurologists that my brain is very sensitive to the side effects of the drugs. The anxiety has only developed since being on the Clonazepam and seems to have worsened whenever the dose has been increased. Could Clonazepam cause anxiety?I have now lost my confidence to leave the house, even with my walker as during a myoclonus episode it is so vigorous the walker just tips over with me and I have episodes every day, but just do not know when one may occur. I have not walked as far as the end of my road about 100 meters for nearly five months now and even with friends still feel apprehensive when walking even a short distance with them. I have lost my confidence to stand in the kitchen to do chores in case I have an episode. I often crawl around on the floor, especially when tired as tiredness definitely increases the episodes and the higher dosage of Clonazepam makes me feel very tired by midday.I am also under stress at home as I am a carer of my 86 year old father who has Alzheimer\\s, although I get some support from social services with carers, who come in to get him up and his breakfast and then his evening meal. I am normally a very positive person, but right now I wonder if I will ever get better. I am keen to start CBT. But, I am still concerned that Clonazepam initiated the anxiety as a side effect and so would need to withdraw from the Clonazepam in order to recover properly. All I know for certain is I never had myoclonus before my DBS surgery. I never had anxiety or a single fall. Right now, I wish I never had DBS as it done little to help me physically and my quality of life right now is far worse. I am finding it hard to stay positive and feel very discouraged.

You are on a low dose of Venlafaxine (37.5 mg once daily) to manage your anxiety. Usually, the dose will be increased to 75 mg once daily after a week or so. In your case, consult with your doctor about any increase in dosage. It will take one to two weeks for you to get used to the medication, and then you will have the therapeutic benefits gradually. In most people, side effects will wear off when the medication is continued for one to two weeks. If it is difficult for you to manage the side effects or if it does not wear off, consult with your doctor so that he can monitor you and switch to another medication if needed. Follow relaxation techniques like breathing exercise and progressive muscle relaxation. It will help to manage anxiety. I hope this helps. "}]}

However, I got my periods the day I took the first Humog injection. Is it normal to get the period mid follicle stimulation cycle?"}, {"role": "Chatbot", "content": "Hi. Getting periods in between only means that the follicles were not healthy enough. This is usually triggered by poor ovulation induction. Endometrial growth depends on the estradiol release from the follicles. So if follicles are not good, estrogen levels are not correct, so, the endometrial lining will not be healthy enough. In short, I would suggest, if I may, just forget this cycle. During the next cycle, it is better not to have injections as the ovarian response will be poor if stimulation is given every month. Month next to that, have CCQ (Clomiphene citrate) 100 mg from the third day of periods and at the same time start on HMG (Menotropin) or Humog (human menopausal gonadotropin) 75 or 112.5 IU. Further dose depending on follicles response. "}]}

Your gums need complete scaling (cleaning) but due to COVID-19, you cannot have now. If the gums are swollen, you will definitely have a wobble feel.

But if there is no improvement then other evaluations have to be done including your blood pressure testing, eye check up and if necessary brain scan. If there is an improvement then you can take the contraceptive pills for three to four months and then stop and observe. "}]}

Staying indoors excessively does not directly cause social anxiety. It is possible that having social anxiety will prevent you from going out more, which in turn makes anxiety more prominent. Talk to your parents and family about your anxiety so that they can understand and support you. Are you able to manage to go to school or college? Try going out regularly. Avoidance does not help. Regular exposure to anxiety-provoking situations will help to treat anxiety. Exercise regularly. It will lower stress and improve your confidence. Practice deep breathing techniques and progressive muscle relaxation exercises for about 20 to 30 minutes daily. If anxiety is more generalized and severe, consult a doctor for an assessment. Counseling can be beneficial. "}]}

I had my tonsils removed as a kid, so they definitely are not the issue. I was thinking this might be caused by allergies, the trees and plants around are starting to bloom.

If the cavity is near the pulp, you will have to go for a root canal and again short roots will not create a problem with that but the crown placement might be affected.

Thalassemia is an inherited blood disorder characterized by abnormal hemoglobin production. I do not have to explain you much about thalassemia as your doctor might have told you the details and consequences about it. Few symptoms and complications that you need to be aware of due to thalassemia are as follows: Major complications that you need to consider is iron overload, which could either be due to recurrent blood transfusion or due to excess cell break down. Comming to the weakness, it is generally due to low hemoglobin. Symptoms of anemia can result in feeling tired and pale skin. A decrease in the hemoglobin level was mainly due to blood transfusion. The patient can be on iron supplements, and it requires about two months on an average to improve hemoglobin level. Ferritin is a protein that stores iron and releases it when the body needs it. It usually lives in the body's cells, with very little circulating in the blood. Treatment will be based on patient\\s response, how the patient responds to the chelating agent, etc. For more information consult an internal medicine physician online "}]}

Especially if the case got relapsed. You must have got the second treatment done and then at end get fixed retainer at palatal and lingual side of your teeth for like good 10 years. This is the only way to avoid relapse. Moreover, if you are having tongue thrust, there is an appliance for it. I would suggest you to get treatment done (which could be fourth time) with conventional bracketing. And at the end, ask the dentist to put fixed retainer. After it gives you an appliance to limit tongue thrust. This would not cause relapse, hopefully.

You have given an excellent description of a common problem in persons who have a desk-based job. The condition you are experiencing is due to poor posture. Stretching and looking away from your constant position is helpful as you have also figured out. Get up and move around after every half an hour. Keep the top of your computer screen at your eye level while sitting with your back supported in the chair. You can do intermittent stretches of your neck and shoulder muscles. Practice isometric and range of motion exercises of the neck which will help you a lot. Take painkillers and apply an anti-inflammatory gel locally for immediate relief.

The undescended testis still lies in the groin. I used to feel fatigued most of the times over the years, due to which I had difficulty in concentrating, focussing and managing day-to-day tasks. About a year ago, I started on TRT (testosterone replacement therapy). I used injectables (Nebido) for seven months. TRT worked very well for six months and I experienced positive results in various aspects (better focus, better memory, energetic, improved libido, was able to manage my tasks very well). After six months my hemoglobin increased from 16.6 to 18.5 and hematocrit went up from 46 to 54, and my doctor advised to donate blood. At this point, I started feeling fatigued and headache (typical high hemoglobin symptoms).I donated blood for the first time three months ago. However, after donation, I felt less energy and benefits of TRT also started fading away. Within a month, hemoglobin again went up from 16 to 17.6 and hematocrit was at 51. I went through venesection two months ago to bring it down. From then onwards, on the advice of my doctor, I switched from injectables to gel (Testogel).

I would like to know as to why you are receiving testosterone replacement therapy. I know that you have mentioned that you have one undescended testis. But many men do not have any problem even when they have a single functional testis. Testosterone replacement therapy is given only when there are both low levels of testosterone in the blood (less than 300 ng/dl) as well as symptoms of low testosterone. Your elevated hemoglobin is a direct result of the increased red cell count due to the effect of testosterone. Testosterone replacement therapy is contraindicated in people with a hematocrit of more than 50. I would suggest that you speak to your doctor and discontinue the testosterone replacement therapy for a few months and increase your ferritin levels to 100. If your symptoms improve, you need to get your treatment plan reviewed. Thank you. For more information consult a hematologist online "}]}

Jaundice is a state in the human body in which there is an increase in bilirubin (produced in the liver) level causing yellowish discoloration of sclera and skin.

But the picture you have attached (attachment removed to protect patient identity) is of antibiotic combination which is used in the treatment of typhoid fever (Cefixime and Ofloxacin). We cannot diagnose typhoid just by symptoms, and we need to perform some blood tests for it. You should take a lot of fluids and glucose water. If it is acute viral hepatitis, the yellowish discoloration or jaundice takes a month to disappear. You should not worry much about it, but get a full liver function test done along with PT (prothrombin time) and INR (international normalized ratio). Also if interested, get a screen for IgM anti HAV (hepatitis A virus) and HEV (hepatitis E virus) serology.

I have seen the pictures attached along with your complaint (attachment removed to protect patient identity). It looks like trench mouth (in dental terms acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis). It is one of the common dental disease caused by bacterial infection. It is aggravated by stress, weak immune system, or habits such as smoking. It is usually painful and ulcerative.  Instead of Ibuprofen and Listerine mouthwash, I suggest using warm salt water rinse thrice daily or Colgate Peroxyl rinses twice daily after meals. Just use 10 mL of the mouthwash to gargle for one minute and spit it out. This helps in pain relief and removing dead tissue on the ulcers. Please avoid smoking habit if you do and also avoid hot and spicy food. Brushing and flossing are to be continued, and never stop doing it. But, avoid vigorous brushing. The indentation and the white gums in between the teeth is the appearance of the ulceration and this disease usually presents in this form. It will heal as you do the rinse treatment along with good oral hygiene. Meanwhile, I also advise you visit your dentist to get a professional cleaning done along with a blood check up to confirm any underlying infection. You might also be prescribed an antibiotic medication for the same. For more information consult a dentist online "}]}

Weak D in itself is a specific category of blood group. Weak D expression primarily results from single point mutations in RhD which encode amino acid changes predicted to be intracellular or in the transmembrane regions of RhD. Molecular RhD blood group typing is very efficient for managing donors and patients carrying any of the various molecular types of weak D and partial D. Weak D people belonging to weak type 1, 2, 3, 4.0, 4.1, and 5 can be treated as Rh-positive and be transfused by Rh-positive red blood cells, while subjects with weak type 4.2\\x80\\x9311 and 15 should be treated as Rh-negative and transfused with Rh-negative red blood cells. Ideally, it is important to know the status of the blood group of the mother if she is Rh negative so that anti D injections can be given to prevent complications in subsequent pregnancies if the baby is Rh positive. A weak D positive is generally considered as Rh positive and usually, the anti D injections are not required in such patients. It should not affect either your wife or baby during her first pregnancy and subsequent pregnancies as well. Thank you. For more information consult a hematologist online "}]}

Frequent urination continues till today. I also had Keflex last month, a full panel STD test this month, and everything was negative.

Throbbing pain or sensitivity in a root canal treated tooth is an indication of re-infection in it.

Medications- Take Augmentin 625 mg, tablet Metronidazole 400 mg and Brufen 400 mg for five days, twice a day. It will heal the infection and there will be no need for further treatment, your tooth will be back to normal. 2. If infection recurs after medicine regime like in 2 or 6 months with severe pain then cap will be removed for a while, re-endo or root canal treatment will be done, that is, deep cleaning of roots will be done and then it will be sealed again once infection is gone and tooth cap will be put again.

But their blood immune system did not match to have a baby.I have these questions:Do the same blood group create problem? If yes then what basically create problems?Are there any precautions that need to consider for having baby after getting married with same blood group?Are the diseases like thalassemia occurring because of parent\\s rhesus factors?One thing to clarify to clarify is that we are two brothers and two sisters and all the six members of my family have same blood group O positive.

Based on your query, my opinion is as follows: There are two major blood group systems and more than 400 minor blood group systems. The major blood group systems are ABO system and Rhesus system, which are important. In the ABO system, there is A, B, AB and O. While in Rhesus, if it is present, it is positive and if not then negative. If the girl is not a relative then blood group is hardly a concern. If both are O positive, it would not matter. If she is a relative, get genetic tests to rule out any common diseases, which can affect the future kid. This test is called as genetic counseling. Only among close relatives, the immune system behaves dangerously due to reduced genetic pool. To conclude, having a common blood group is not a problem. She can donate blood to you and you to her in emergencies just like your siblings can. No other complications with same blood group.

You have clearly described several psychosomatic symptoms. On the core of such symptoms is anxiety. Anxiety can take several forms and can manifest in different ways in different individuals. For some it may be palpitations and breathlessness, for some it might be butterflies in the stomach, frequent micturition, etc. Gabapentin is a good anti-anxiety medication but it can cause day time sedation (which you had).

The fact that dengue cannot happen in the same season is true to some extent but not absolutely. Let me explain. Dengue is a viral infection caused by the bite of infected ades aegypti mosquito. Every mosquito bite will not lead to dengue fever as for infection to happen. First, the mosquito should be infected by the dengue virus (DEV). By infection of the mosquito I mean, the mosquito just serves as a vector or carrier for virus transfer to humans. Also, every mosquito carrying the dengue virus would not lead to dengue fever, shock, etc. Some people just have subclinical, asymptomatic infections too. There are actually four types of dengue viruses numbered from 1 to 4. Infection with one type, followed by recovery confers immunity to that type of infection. Our body produces antibodies against the virus and protects us from further infection, with time these antibodies fade away. So immunity in DEV is present but is short-lived. It can be said that the infection cannot occur in the same season, but if an infection with another type say (DEV type 1 followed by DEV type 2) occurs, the body does not have antibodies which are protective against type 2, as the body was previously infected by DEV type 1. This type of infection is more dangerous. However, in a season only one type of DEV infection occurs usually. I hope this helps. "}]}

Other options are a series of glycolic acid chemical peel and microdermabrasion which will help to exfoliate the skin, and it lightens the pigment.

{"messages": [{"role": "User", "content": "Hi doctor,Twelve days ago I had protected sex with a girl I did not know after a night out. I showered that night maybe an hour afterward and used a perfume smelling body wash or shampoo. Whether it was in my head or actual, the next day I noticed an itchiness or rather a need to readjust my penis which persisted on and off for about a week with no other symptoms, visual or pain or burning. A week after the incident, the itch progressed to something between an itch and an occasional burn on the underside of the head of my penis where the ridge of the glans meets, but in total very mild, and I did not think much of it at the time. In the weeks prior and the week subsequent I was traveling with a lot of daily exercises and occasionally limited ability to shower or use shampoo. Eight days after the night out I noticed a small patch of red bumps that looked somewhat rash like in the same small area. To be specific, they do not look like pimples nor are they very raised and do not look to contain any liquid or if they do a minuscule and clear amount. The weird thing is that when these first came about, the itching also stopped, and I have no other symptoms such as discharge, burning while urinating, or other health issues. In days 10 to 12, I have had no such symptoms as well but the ridge of my glans penis around the front side of the head now appears to have symptoms similar to what balanitis may look like from other research, with a slightly swollen and red penis head and a rashy or bumpy looking appearance to the edges of the head. The itching has stopped, and from online research I figured it may be something like jock itch, a male yeast infection or another fungal situation so I began using an antifungal cream yesterday. The original red bumps on the back of the head have faded somewhat and have not blistered or scabbed or popped or shed any skin which I have been vigilant about from reading online. I am wondering if you can shed any light on my situation as I am worried just like any person experiencing STD scares."}, {"role": "Chatbot", "content": "Hi, Welcome to BayMax forum.

If you are developing radicular pain and losing your bladder and bowel, then it is an emergency and you need to quickly consult your spine surgeon.

Enlarged prostate can shrink by 30% if Dutasteride is given. But, this does not guarantee that the patient will become catheter free.

{"messages": [{"role": "User", "content": "Hello doctor,The period was two days late. When it started, it was watery. Then on the second day, it had some clots. Then it thinned up again and ended with brown blood. Why?"}, {"role": "Chatbot", "content": "Hello. How are you doing? The possibilities for this periods are: For normal bleeding, you need a normal hormonal support to the endometrium, ovulation and the proper and complete bleeding. But, in your history I note your BMI (body mass index) is very high, Your expected weight is 52 to 56 kg. This extra fat is converted to hormones in the body which alters the normal hormone balance, leading to the poor formation and improper bleeding, which can appear as such a brown discharge, fleshy mass, and mucoid discharge. This needs only weight reduction by at least four to six kg. Any sudden increase or decrease in weight can affect these hormones. Another possibility is an infection around the uterus. If you have any yellowish or white or grayish discharge with or without itching or foul smell especially after sex and periods, pain in the lower abdomen before periods, feverish feeling, this could be an infection in the inner lining. So, the bleeding will be lesser in amount with fleshy masses, brownish and painful. This needs an evaluation by a gynecologist and a good course of antibiotics and antifungal medicines for you and your partner. Periods plus or minus seven days the expected date is normal, so two days is alright. Hope I have clarified your query. Do write back if any more queries.  Take care."}]}

Watch it with the same formula milk for next 24 hours, feed more on breast feeding, and keep a watch on urine output. It may settle down slowly.

When NT (nuchal translucency) is towards higher value than a baby is more likely having a problem. Now there are two prenatal tests which can be done at 12 weeks.

And if high risk than how much is the risk, statistically like 1:148, which means there is a chance of one pregnancy to come positive for downs in every 148 pregnancy. So for further confirmation have to send liquid around a baby for examination. In that, we remove fluid under sonography guidance and send it for examination. They segregate fetal cells from it and do a DNA test for confirmation. But this test is directly invasive and also have some possibilities of side effects, so we avoid on the first basis. Because if it comes as low risk in double marker than no need to send liquid around the baby. So consult with your gynecologist and have detail about which test is carried and possible results. "}]}

If you are spiritual, try visiting holy places regularly if you find it helpful. You have said that you feel happy when you are around the people and low again when lonely, this is understandable. People feel better in practical social situations.

Usually, it takes 1 to 2 months for recovery from surgery and 3 to 4 months for muscles to regain their usual strength after ACL surgery. Since you cannot exercise it means that your muscles have not reached their optimal strength till now. Arthrofibrosis is a common complication after such surgery that can prevent you from exercising. But to know the exact cause, I would suggest you have MRI or bone scan of the knee joint to know the exact cause. Also, I would advise you to have physiotherapy sessions. "}]}

The fat in the chicken can be removed by removing the skin, where as beef has inbuilt fat which cannot be removed easily hence we suggest to include fish and chicken avoiding beef. Considering fat, we miss out on other nutrients too, so it is advised to reduce the oil intake like healthy individuals can take half a liter of oil per month if you are two your cooking should be within 1 liter of oil only.

However, by applying Vaseline twice a day I have noticed the dryness to subside, although the red rash will typically remain.I have been tested for STD\\s and have had a yeast swab test all come back negative. The doctor ruled out herpes by looking at it and said it was mild balanitis (inflammation of the glans). However, I have been washing with just warm water daily (ruling out any allergic reactions to soap) and keeping the area dry.
