I have gone through what you have mentioned and understand your anxiety about your son\\s eyesight. - 11D and - 8D are high myopic powers and the chances are that the power may progress as your son is still young.

Every six monthly visits or follow up visits as per doctors advise. Since the myopia is of a high degree, there will be excessive stretching and degeneration of the structures of the eyeball. This can cause problems such as retinal detachment. Regular follow-ups help us in picking up changes faster and in preventing such complications as retinal detachment. 3.

I understand your concern. Trench mouth or acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis (ANUG) is a bacterial infection and is uncommon nowadays but it is highly associated with HIV infection and in kids with nutritional deficiencies. To be diagnosed with trench mouth or ANUG, symptoms like gum necrosis and ulceration, pain and bleeding (on just touching the gums) should be present. The main characteristic feature is fetid or the putrid odor which is caused due to the rotting gum tissue. And people diagnosed with ANUG has this odor, unless if they are under treatment in a very initial stage. It is certainly difficult for people with ANUG to eat a portion of normal or even less spicy food if they are not under treatment. It is treatable within a week by the usual antibiotic regimen and medicated mouth rinses. Gum infection such as this cannot occur only by fellatio.

Although this information gives us some idea, it is challenging for me to guess what precisely this growth is. It will be nice if your mom could have it evaluated by an orthopedic surgeon. He or she will assess whether this growth is arising from the subcutaneous fat (example - lipoma), underlying muscle or bone or joint. If there is a suspicion of bony or joint involvement, an x-ray may need to be taken. There is a rare possibility that this swelling might not be a growth, but just a manifestation of trauma or infection. I will be happy to review any pictures, x-rays or other imaging that you may have already done. Hope this helps. "}]}

I have gone through your lab reports (attachment removed to protect patient identity) and they are consistent with the diagnosis made by your doctor.Yellowish tint of the eyes is due to increased bilirubin levels. This is due to the increased red blood cell destruction in the spleen and is commonly a complication of hereditary spherocytosis. It is understandable that you are feeling weak since your body is producing red blood cells at an accelerated rate to compensate for the destruction occurring in the spleen. This is also the reason why your spleen is enlarged. If your condition worsens, your doctor might suggest a splenectomy. This will not cure the condition but will relieve the symptoms since the site of destruction of red blood cells will be removed and your red blood cells will be able to survive for a longer period in the blood. Splenectomy, however, can predispose one to certain bacterial infections and it is important that you receive the appropriate vaccines regularly. You could take folic acid and vitamin B12 supplements since one of your blood tests show macrocytic anemia. For more information consult a hematologist online "}]}

This can be a cardiac arrhythmia like PSVT (paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia) or atrial fibrillation, in which heart rate suddenly goes up and also suddenly decreases. And one may get symptoms like shortness of breath, chest pain or heaviness, dizziness, etc. Are you having ventricular or atrial ectopics? Have you undergone echo? Presence of ectopics also suggests the possibility of these arrhythmias. Usually, ECG is normal (attachment removed to protect patient identity) as it is done in between the episodes or may show ectopics. ECG done during episodes will show abnormality. You may request for portable cardiac monitor either Holter or another mobile-based rhythm monitor especially during intercourse to see the rhythm is recurring. Alternatively, you may undergo treadmill test and we can see if it recurs during the running.  Also, thyroid test should be done if not had recently. ln order to abort such episodes you should try to cough hard. Next time, you have this, focus on heart rate and measure pulse rate. These arrhythmias are not life-threatening. So overall, that episode may be an episode atrial arrhythmia rather than panic attack and our priority is to confirm it by investigations.

The likely reasons are PCOS (polycystic ovarian syn .  You need to get a complete hormonal profile with serum estradiol and serum testosterone levels with ultrasound pelvis to look for ovarian cysts (PCOS). The bleeding post intercourse is likely due to cervical erosions, which can cause bleeding and hence, a per speculum exam with a Pap smear is necessary as well. The ultrasound can deduce the endometrial thickness and if thick then an endometrial biopsy may also be taken for histopathological examination and learning the phase of the endometrium. In the meantime, you should be placed on antifibrinolytics like Tranexamic acid for controlling heavy bleeding. Obesity itself is a part of insulin resistance in PCOS, which can cause ovulation and hence delayed menses often. Please review with reports for further discussion and advice. "}]}

Just get it examined, if they feel, they can order an ultrasound of breast or needle biopsy, (although I am pretty sure that is not needed). A mammogram is not a good option for you as due to age.

To answer, let me explain to you how a nerve grows. It takes one month of latency and later nerve grows at 1 mm per day. Even though the nerve might reach your muscle, for bulk to improve, it takes another few months. For one to determine if the nerve signals have improved, you can get an electromyography to see for any improvement. Decompression will improve sensation very fast and then power. But for muscle bulk, it usually takes a while for muscle transfer to be suitable. In case, you have any form of weakness and never to fill up a cosmetic defect such as hypothenar flatness, for that one can consider fat grafting. If the bulk does not improve after six months. I would advise you to wait as it usually takes longer than 14 weeks. If you want to see and have proof of progress go for EMG.

But, sometimes, it happens when the swelling gets increased and when the fever becomes uncontrollable for two to three days. There is a chance to have a cystic lesion due to the chronic infection.

How much worried you should be about his tonsil and sleep apnea problem are: 1. Change in facial features producing adenoid facies. 2. Irritability of kid. 3. He cannot hear properly due to adenoids blocking ear tubes. 4. Ear discharge. 5. Reduced development of speech. Do not get worried just because of the snoring and sleep apnea. Give him nasal steroids and antihistaminic syrup (like Zyrtec or Allegra syrup) of appropriate dosage. In some cases, we even give oral steroid syrup. It does not cause any stunting the way you have understood. Once you exhaust the above medical treatment option and find no or not much benefit we can discuss about the surgery. Your doctor is right in giving the medicines Flonase, etc. That is the protocol. We can follow the same here. The decision to operate may vary with different surgeon.

Premature ejaculation is not a disease of the body and it is seen in almost all men at some point.

Practicing exercises to strengthen the muscles which help in ejaculation and retraining penis to ejaculate late would be a permanent solution rather than medicine. No permanent cure with allopathy, ayurveda or any system. It happens because of so many factors like as follows: 1. You have been training your penis to ejaculate early all these days. 2. You will be very anxious about losing the erection and will hurry up for intercourse. 3. Glans of the penis may be very sensitive. 4. The desire may be too much.

I am assuming that you have regular monthly periods. In that case, it is the time where you are going to ovulate. So, it is an unsafe period to have sex. And, if you have once unprotected sex and have taken I-pill (emergency contraceptive pill) once, then why to make mistake for the second time. Because, I-pill in itself is not 100% effective even if taken once. There is no study about two times taken I-pill. It works with two mechanisms. First of all, it will delay ovulation and second, it brings bleeding. So, if pregnancy happens, it resists implantation. In your case, if I believe that ovulation is delayed while you have taken the tablet, then it is good. If you have taken the tablet for the second time, then the ovulation is more delayed and period will be somewhat late with more chance of avoiding pregnancy. The second thing is that with I-pill your period cycle can become irregular. The chance of that increases more if you have taken two times. Because, it is a chemical (hormone), which is produced in your body to maintain your regular cycle. And, when you take it from outside it can disturb your normal cycle. If you do not want pregnancy in the first place, then either use condom or other method as preferred by you both after discussing with your doctor. I-pill is an emergency contraceptive and not a regular contraceptive pill that you can take as and when required. It should be taken when fear of failure of normal contraception is more.

According to your statement, you have been suffering from difficulty in breathing due to aching of the left rib part that radiates toward shoulder which may occur when you fall asleep on sofa in an awkward position. You think your ribs may hurt from sleeping wrong and aching of the rib may radiate towards its intercostal muscle. You may feel a sharp pain after intercostal muscle strain or sprain due to sleeping in the wrong position. The pain will become worse when you stretch, breathe in deeply, cough, or sneeze. The area of the strain between your ribs may be painful to touch. Again this pain can radiate to shoulders or sometimes side sleeping can cause damage to the rotator cuff and create a lot of pressure in this group of tendons and eventually produce pain. You can take Tramadol as a painkiller, Domperidone, Lansoprazole, and Diazepam as a muscle relaxant with a sleeping pill. "}]}

Your symptoms are mostly dizziness, which worsens with sudden eye movements or body movements, and are sometimes associated with headaches. Based on the symptoms, the most common cause in your age group is a vestibular migraine or benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). I assume you do not have any other risk factors such as diabetes, hypertension, previous stroke or diagnosis of epilepsy. A simple neurological exam using Dix Hallpike Maneuver can help differentiate between BPPV and vestibular migraine. Also, further questions on the quality of headache, location and associated symptoms such as light sensitivity, loud noise sensitivity and nausea are other important questions, that can happen with vestibular migraine. Treatment for BPPV is physiotherapy with some specific exercises and medicines such as Topiramate or Valproic acid for vestibular migraine. If there are any red flags on neurological exam, then an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) of the brain would be needed. Please do not hesitate to ask me any other questions. Take care.

I have only been eating a couple of things daily and live off that."}, {"role": "Chatbot", "content": "Hello,  Welcome to BayMax. RAST is a highly accurate test. If the test is positive for a specific allergen, it shows that you are sensitized to that particular allergen. This means that you may mount an allergic response when you are exposed to that allergen. However, it does not mean that you will necessarily have an allergic reaction to that substance and, nor does it mean that any reactions will be severe. If the test is negative, it means that one does not have the ability to mount an allergic reaction to that allergen and any symptoms one may be experiencing are probably not due to an allergic reaction to that substance. However, the results of the RAST need to be interpreted in conjunction with your clinical history. e.g the presence of allergy to some or few allergens which may possibly be present either in the environment or food does not necessarily mean that they are responsible for the symptoms because if they are not even present in the environment or food of an individual, then they are irrelevant. In your case, an elimination diet has not helped thus proving the fact that RAST test results should be carefully interpreted along with clinical history and does not necessarily mean that you will necessarily have an allergic reaction to the substance that you tested. Angioedema is frequently associated with urticaria. Pathogenesis is the same for both urticaria as well as angioedema. The presence of angioedema does not always mean that it is a part of anaphylaxis. Angioedema can be a part of anaphylaxis in those individuals who have a severe allergic reaction to an allergen with high levels of antibodies circulating in the blood. Since you have only class 1 and 2 level antibodies therefore it is unlike that these antigens or allergens would cause anaphylaxis. "}]}

Most of them advise liver function tests after two weeks to see if the dose is not giving you side effects. But that can usually be followed up with rheumatology nurse.

As for Rheumatoid factor, 8 or 11, can be lab variation or instrument variation, but as long as you do not have joint swellings or pain it is insignificant. My diagnosis for pain would go for fibromyalgia. It is more of a diagnosis of exclusion and one only considers it after ruling out the other causes, which they have done so far. I will give you a link, you can go through it and let me know if your symptoms match this. As treatment will depend on your being convinced about the diagnosis. I hope this helps. Fibromyalgia. "}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "User", "content": "Hello doctor,When I was 11 years old, I was knocked off my bike and cracked my front tooth in half horizontally, shortly after the dentist fixed it. Since then I have had no problems with it and had multiple x-rays to check on it. When it happened, the color of the tooth changed very slightly, to a very slightly more yellow shade than the rest of my teeth. I am curious to know what happened when the trauma occurred. Did my tooth die? What are they checking for when they x-ray the tooth?"}, {"role": "Chatbot", "content": "Hello. I have been through your query and can understand your concern. Any trauma to the tooth generally has long-term consequences like tooth discoloration, etc. As you said that your tooth was fractured, it might have led to a slight injury to the pulp or even if not so, the fracture line would have been close to the pulp. In both cases, the pulp over time starts to become non-vital sometimes due to injury and sometimes due to the restorative material lying in close proximity to the pulp. This over time results in the discoloration of the tooth. The characteristic feature of this discoloration will be that only the involved tooth will be discolored and other teeth will be normal or not discolored. If that is the case, it generally means that the tooth is in the process of becoming non-vital till the tooth becomes slight brownish black which means the tooth is entirely non-vital. It is generally not associated with any kind of pain as the process is chronic and takes time to set in. I would advise you to have a visit to your nearest dentist. He would prescribe a vitality test of the tooth and also would get an x-ray for the tooth. By that way, he would come to know if the tooth is dead or still vital and accordingly will propose treatment. If the tooth is vital, he will put some medication over the pulp to let it heal and then fill with the pulp friendly restoration. However, if the tooth is dead, I would suggest you to go for the root canal treatment (after evaluating the condition of the tooth and soft tissue). Meanwhile, keep your oral hygiene good, brush twice daily and floss regularly. Use mouth rinses to clean the mouth after meals. "}]}

It seems from the history that you are having viral conjunctivitis involving both the eyes. Coming to your first question, viral conjunctivitis remains infective in the initial three to five days hence no need to worry about the reinfection from the one eye that is still healing. Usually, viral conjunctivitis follows a self-limiting course of 7 to 10 days. Since you are having vision problems in the eye, probably it has involved cornea resulting in viral keratoconjunctivitis.  If it has involved the cornea, it takes about three to four weeks to heal. However, the involvement of cornea is not because of infection, but because of immunologically mediated reaction, hence it will resolve even without treatment. However, symptomatic relief can be obtained by using artificial tears, and some severe cases may require the use of steroid eye  .  If possible, send a photo of the affected eye so that I can confirm the diagnosis and answer your question more accurately. I hope the information is helpful to you.  Take care."}]}

At first, I appreciate you because you have so much awareness of your oral health. The life span of normal root canal treated tooth is 5 to 6 years. If you have 15-year-old treated tooth, it means you are so health conscious and take care of your oral hygiene. My opinion is you should go for extraction along with cyst removal because third-time root canal of the same tooth is not a good idea. Periodontitis is nothing but an infection of gum tissue which is totally curable and depends upon your oral hygiene. Bone resorption is a kind of bone loss due to demineralization. There are many things which are responsible for that like age factor, some diseases, calcium level, gingivitis with periodontitis is also a cause of bone loss. "}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "User", "content": "Hello doctor,You were wonderful in allaying some health anxiety over some skin issues several months ago. So, I thought I would consult with you on another question pertaining to my son. Unfortunately, a combination of my health anxiety and the big mistake of searching online has my mind imagining the worst with regard to my son. My son is 19 years old and has no diagnosed medical issues. I noticed back when he was about eight or ten years old that he had a mark resembling a cafe au lait mark on his back, in the upper shoulder area. I had always asked the pediatrician to look at it during his yearly physicals, and they made nothing of it. Throughout the years it has grown a bit and has become darker and more rough in texture. It is probably slightly less than an inch in length and looks like a few small lesions grouped together. Again, I have brought it to the pediatrician\\s attention and he was not concerned. Three months ago, I made an appointment for him and my other son with a dermatologist for a skin exam, and I pointed out the spots which I wanted to be checked in particular. We met with the physician\\s assistant there, and my younger son had a peculiar spot I pointed out, of which the PA conducted a shave biopsy, which came back as a mildly atypical junctional nevus. For my older son, I pointed out the spot on his back/shoulder, and the PA diagnosed it as a linear epidermal nevus. She said the chances of it becoming dangerous are slim to none. It may darken throughout the years, and they will simply monitor it at yearly visits. Unfortunately, I went on to research online about epidermal nevi and of course I ran into information showing a possible link to epidermal nevus syndrome and all of its associated neurological and skeletal defects. As I said, he is 19 and has no medical issues, is extremely intelligent, etc. In your opinion, is it safe to say that I should not be concerned about those syndromes? I presume it is primarily related to the numerous and systemic epidermal nevi, which he does not have, and I would think it would have presented by now? And my last even more neurotic question. My online research led me to some information saying that a certain type of epidermal nevus could be related to a gene mutation that could be passed along to an offspring, with them having possible serious skin scaling conditions, etc. Again, he has just one solitary small epidermal nevus. No biopsy was done, as the PA did not feel it was necessary. Do you feel there is any need for me to worry about that potential genetic mutation? Thank you so much for reading my long query."}, {"role": "Chatbot", "content": "Hello, Welcome to BayMax forum. A solitary epidermal nevus is very common and does not pose any kind of serious health concern. Neither is a biopsy required. You are right. Any associated symptom should have been present since birth or early childhood in this case. Even if it is passed on to the future generations, it is harmless. A yearly medical examination is more than enough for the nevi in both your kids. Good luck. "}]}

Moreover, no clot was found nor was there any change suggesting peripheral vascular disease. It is absolutely safe to fly and you need not worry about it. An arterial Doppler will be able to make out if you have a clot. D-dimer test is only for the veins and is not useful in arterial disease.

Any kind of debris inside the cyst will give rise to echogenicity in USG. It could be blood, it could be tissues of different origin. There are different types of ovarian cyst, to rule out malignancy you need to do certain tumor markers like CA 125, etc., and MRI or CT scan. Since it is receding in size, my best guess that your cyst is some kind of retention cyst of ovary. There is a large possibility that the cyst will regress soon. I think your cyst is an incidental finding as you have stated there is minimal symptom. Your gynecologist will be the best person to advise you in this matter. So discuss with her about the various possibilities and methods of treatment. "}]}

I have reviewed your health query and can well understand you are worried about your heart health. I would not say to stop Xarelto (Rivaroxaban) and/or Cordarone (Amiodarone) as these are very important medications and you need them. For stent patients, Xarelto reduces the risk of strokes, pulmonary embolism, and deep venous thrombosis, and clots initiating from the stents area. It is a blood thinning agent and keeps the blood running in veins and arteries without excessive clotting. Cordarone, on the other hand, keeps you away from heart rhythm problems like AF (atrial fibrillation). With the fact that you are having no arrhythmias while taking this medication, I do not think there is an obvious need to change the dosage. If your cardiologist gets some indication to reduce the dosage after examining you physically, that would be a different story. My final suggestion is to consult your treating physician before changing medications. Hope this helps. For more infiormation consult a cardiologist online "}]}

My family is interested in a pet and I have had negative skin prick and blood work tests for dander. Before we bring a pet in and before my kids become bonded, is it reasonable to assume negative tests will translate in no reactions. Occasionally, when I interact with animals, I have a reaction but it is difficult to determine whether it is actually the pollen which I am highly allergic to."}, {"role": "Chatbot", "content": "Hi. Skin prick allergy testing is one of the most accurate ways of diagnosing the allergen, one is sensitive to. It is definitely more accurate than blood immunoCAP testing (blood allergy testing). Skin prick testing checks your sensitivity to the protein in question. Even if sensitive, it need not mean you are allergic. Whereby, a positive result need not always mean you will get allergy with the protein. It means that your immune system is sensitised to that allergen and that an allergy can occur in subsequent exposures to the allergen. A negative in skin prick testing will mean that you are not sensitive to that protein and that you will not end with an allergy upon its exposure. This is true. But it is specific for the particular type of allergen. What all animal danders were included in your profile and what was the response to each? Is there a photograph or record of the wheal or flare that developed after each prick? Was the test read by a clinical allergist or immunologist and were you provided a report as to that you are not allergic to any animal dander? Were you diagnosed with pollen allergy or sensitivity? Have you observed any symptoms of allergy while in gardens or bushy areas? Or in any particular season? Does any one else in your family have allergies? "}]}

If you can feel the string the chance that IUD is in the right place is very high so you should not worry too much. Taking Motrin (Ibuprofen) and applying heating pads should help with cramping.

I have gone through your ECG (attachment removed to protect patient identity). The reports mentioned on ECG are machine generated and are frequently inaccurate. There is no clear-cut evidence of myocardial infarction on ECG. As you also do not have any history of chest pain, it is unlikely for you to have any heart attack. And yes, heart rate is low and it is sinus bradycardia. Do you have any symptoms of dizziness, syncope, etc? If not then it needs no action at the moment. However, you should undergo thyroid test to rule out hypothyroidism as a cause for low heart rate. Also, should undergo echo, which will additionally provide the assurance to rule out MI. Also, if echo is normal then should have TMT (treadmill test), which will help in ruling out minor blockages, subclinical ischemic heart disease and to look for maximum heart rate you achieve during exercise, which will help in determining the benign nature of sinus bradycardia if the adequate heart rate is achieved. Also, high bp can also cause low heart rate by a reflex mechanism. So you should have medicine for it. I guess you are not receiving any medicines like beta blockers which can reduce heart rate. You should have tablet Telma CTD (Telmisartan and Chlorthalidone) 40/12.5 mg once a day in the morning for hypertension so get it prescribed by a local doctor.

But if the child cannot walk properly despite having a normal X-ray, and normal phosphate level, then consult with an orthopedic consultant. He will help your child by suggesting some good orthoses. I suggest you do a repeat PTH test and to do a serum phosphate level. Also, continue the Calcium and Vitamin D supplementation. Inadequate treatment. PTH, serum phosphate.

Do not take Paracetamol when there is no pain but do complete the Amoxicillin course. Additionally, you can take any one for gastritis if you have a tendency to develop gastritis with antibiotics. You can take PAN-D (Pantoprazole) or Omez (Omeprazole). Take them on empty stomach. Do salt water rinse regularly. You can apply clove oil at the site, it is a good anti-inflammatory. Maintain good oral hygiene regularly, but for sure get it treated. Avoid eating from the affected side until it gets treated or even if you eat make sure nothing gets lodged in that tooth.

Repeat the same thing in the next cycle by stopping the active pills one day prior, that is, 20th day, while starting the new pack on Sundays every time. So in four cycles, your dates will be as per your schedule with stable efficacy of the pills too. I hope, I could help you with your query. Please revert back, if want a shorter alternative. "}]}

This could be ovulation bleeding. Usually it may take about 6 months to conceive after stopping the birth control pills.

There is possibility of DUB (Dysfunctional Uterine Bleeding) or ectopic pregnancy or threatened abortion. It can be seen once your period date is over.

I can go even more than 30 times a day - majority of these times, I feel an increased urgency. However, when I go, only a small amount or drops come out. For the past two to three days, the urgency kind of feels to be getting worse, I feel as if I will not be able to hold it. However, I am still able to as there is no leaking. There is no burning or irritation or any discharge. No recent sexual encounters and no other associated symptoms. I take Coveram 10/10 for essential hypertension and Valdoxan 25 because I also do suffer from anxiety. I have been under stress lately as I was doing my exams this past week and finished today. I have done a few tests at my family doctor: Last week I did a dipstick which was normal apart from +1 protein. Voiding bladder US was normal (450 mL pre voiding, 45 mL post voiding). An initial urine culture was normal according to my doctor. Yesterday, I performed another dipstick and urine culture. The dipstick was normal, and early urine microscopy showed 10 to 100 white cell count. We are waiting for the cultures to return. Due to the result of the white cell count, my doctor said it would be worth a try to undergo a 5-day course of antibiotics (Keflex).Today is my third day of antibiotic treatment, symptoms are largely the same. Today, I attempted to hold my bladder. It felt fine in the morning but as the day went on, my symptoms returned and I am finding it harder to hold my bladder. Also, for the first time, I tried going for a run. The entire time I felt a heaviness in my bladder and felt a strong urge to urinate, even though I went before my run began. What do you think could be going on? My doctor believes that it is either a UTI, or most likely, a hypersensitive bladder due to exam stress. However, there have been days where I have not felt stress at all yet symptoms have continued.

The loosely attached swollen gums over the wisdom tooth is called as pericoronitis. The age of eruption of wisdom teeth is from 17 to 21 years. Beyond that, if the wisdom tooth has not erupted or half erupted gives out pain or swelling, it is highly likely to be locked inside the jaw.  Since they are the last ones to erupt, most of them do not get enough space to erupt and tries anyways and this causes jaw pain, swelling and sometimes the surrounding structures like same side temple, ear and throat also gives out pain. This wisdom tooth is called an impacted tooth. During the first visit, antibiotics and painkillers will be prescribed. The swelling will come down eventually but if that is impacted, it may not come down. Please visit your dentist and get an x-ray of your wisdom tooth to check whether there is enough space for it to erupt and to check whether it is erupting in the right direction. Taking painkillers and antibiotics will help to control pain and swelling but if the tooth is impacted, this will not be a permanent solution. You may require wisdom tooth removal.

There are many factors, other than tight inner thigh muscles that limit the split especially center split. Bony restriction in the hip joint, as the hip joint bone gets jammed into socket because of extreme coxa vara angle (angulation between the neck and shaft of the thigh bone) leading to restrictions in movement. These jams will not happen when you do a side split as there is slight rotation occurring in the joint and allows the action to happen.  Other reason could be ligamentous (pubofemoral ligament) limitation as the ligament tightens and it limits the further movement. This ligament realigns and will relax while doing forward and side split. So, it will not restrict your movement other than center split. You can try tilting your pelvis forward so that there can be some relief with limitation in both the cases. For more information consult a physiotherapist online "}]}

False positivity can be due to user error or cross contamination, if there is ongoing some other illness eg. malaria, or if there is a history of blood transfusion, autoimmune diseases. A positive test result always needs to be routinely confirmed using a different type of test or testing kit. Fourth generation tests are more than 95% accurate at six weeks and this needs to be confirmed after three months with a second test. If the test in your case has been performed at three months after the exposure and is giving negative results, and you have not had another risk, you do not have HIV. Your fourth generation test and RNA PCR at 9 and 10 weeks and further 12 weeks negative RNA PCR, suffices to rule out infection.

When we take pills that contain hormones, it interferes with the natural body hormones. This may sometimes cause breakthrough bleeding too. Hope it helps. Kindly be advised, if you do not want a pregnancy, use barrier contraception. It saves from STDs too. Regards. For more information consult an internal medicine physician online "}]}

Although you have no past medical history for paralysis or limb numbness and weakness, these brain lesions are compatible with MS. I recommend discussing with your neurologist about that. As there is a new lesion (with light contrast enhancement), steroids would help to relieve the tingling in the right toes.

The growth of the child is two weeks smaller for 38 weeks but corresponding to its ultrasound age, the weight of the baby is fine.

A 2-cm kidney stone is a fairly large one and it will definitely require surgery. I cannot recommend using any natural remedies for a stone of this size though they will not affect the stent. The stone, however, can move to cause obstruction again, but this is unlikely if the stent remains in position. The surgery has to be done under general anesthesia. The procedure used varies based on the location of the stone and your treating urologist. I would have to have a look at the CT (computed tomography) scan images before I can make a plan. I would recommend you to go ahead with the surgery as that gives you the best chance of getting your stone removed. For more information consult a urologist online "}]}

I am not sure which part you are living in as you have not mention. Treatment for this is avoidance of cold exposure, wearing warm clothes. Calcium dobesilate gel twice daily. Diltiazem 30 mg tablet BD for 2 weeks during the lesions. For itching you use Loratadine10 mg once daily for two weeks or whenever there is itching. Apply aloevera moisturizing cream over the hands multiple times with rubbing of the hands and feet and the parts so that good circulation bring warm blood flows into those area. "}]}

For it, your partner must be a smoker for 15 to 20 years or over 50 years so that he can spit blood continuously. If your partner does not have these conditions, then you must be calm. Respiratory tract infection can also be a cause for having phlegm with blood. A headache and fever will also support the diagnosis. Poking the nose with a finger can also be a cause for having phlegm with blood because blood can pass from the back of the nose to the pharynx. On considering the age, it is necessary to rule out malignant pathology. If the bleeding is not continuous, then there is no need to get tensed. In addition to bleeding, if your partner has a fever, headache, and cough, then respiratory tract infection will be a probable diagnosis. You can consult a family doctor for evaluation and treatment. If there is a continuation of bleeding and if your partner is a smoker, then it is necessary to do a chest X-ray. "}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "User", "content": "Hello doctor,I am 47 today. I went to my primary doctor three years ago with low libido and poor quality erections. Blood work came back as total testosterone 381 and A1c 6.9. Started exercising and lost weight and inches, 198 lbs to 178, 38-inch waist to 32. Symptoms still persisted. The doctor started me on Clomid 50 mg three times per week.Testosterone shot up to 900\\s but symptoms persisted although Cialis helped with erection quality, still low libido. Will attach a note with test and A1c results during this time. So, I stopped taking the Clomid in March this year and had my physical last week.The doctor says my testosterone is 570, A1c is 6.0 and everything else looks good. He says since I still have symptoms, that I have testosterone resistance. His analogy was; like diabetics, their bodies produce insulin but just does not know what to do with it.So, his treatment recommendation is TRT testosterone replacement therapy along with Clomid. I am hesitant because I feel this therapy is overused nowadays, and I feel pretty good except my libido.Sought a second opinion today from my urologist, he seemed disinterested in me doing that but said if I try a few injections it would not hurt me, then advised me to run this by an endocrinologist.So I guess in summary:Do you believe that testosterone resistance is a valid diagnosis?If I do try the TRT, can I stop after a few weeks or a few injections and get back to the way I am right now with no permanent issues?Should I just start the Clomid again, or just keep using the Cialis and keep working out and trying to clean up my diet more?Any other thoughts and advise would be appreciated.

I have a couple of questions for you: Testosterone resistance is a phenomenon that occurs due to a genetic defect and would have caused problems with puberty and would not appear now in adulthood. Clomid (Clomifene) gave a very good response. I would not advise TRT. The low libido could be due to a variety of other issues and likely not a result of testosterone levels. If the thought is resistance then there would be resistance to exogenous therapy too. Why do we think a chemical would be better than the body's natural testosterone. You are thinking right, eat better. I would recommend reducing animal food consumption which have high sex steroids and these can act as endocrine disrupters.

I note that you have been tried on different SSRIs and mood stabilizers before with no success. It is positive that you have found Venlafaxine XR 75 mg to lessen your anxiety. I will advise to continue with the titration regimen suggested by your prescribing doctor. Do not rush to increase the dose to 150 mg as titration needs to be carefully considered after weighing up your response and any side effects. As you are also on increasing dose of Lamictal it makes sense to do the titration gradually.

I was advised to take bed rest for three months and felt better after five months. Then I got some manipulation done with my lower back and my condition got worse.

It got radiated to hips, thighs and it was worse when I stood up from a sitting position. Then I left with no option except bed rest for another four months that is a total nine months of bed rest. After that I suddenly started walking two to three hours a day in a stretch and started doing some exercises. After few days of getting my body too much into motion I felt my upper back getting stuck and again was unable to move and the pain radiated to my wrist and hand. Then had bed rest for another 10 days and felt a bit better. But, still in pain and resumed with two to three hours of brisk walking and exercises. I noticed that many joints in my body were making cracking sound while I walk or move my body and they were continuous. They are not going away no matter how much I move that joint, the cracking sound will repeat infinite times whenever I move my body. The cracking sound is mostly from lower and upper back, shoulder, ankle, foot fingers, knees also make that cracking sound and it is painful as well.

About seven months ago, he had an episode of foreign body pain in the eye which the contact lens could not control. His optometrist changed the type of lens after remarking that the lens appeared tight. Although the painful sensations have decreased, they are still present with more of a sore feeling now. His ophthalmologist suggested that he discontinue the Azopt drops he had been using in case the preservative was causing some corneal toxicity. His eye pressure without the drops has read at 18 and 20 on separate occasions, but he does have corneal edema which may affect the measurement.

My query is that if the bandage lens has worked so well for pain management for 10 years is it possible that it can continue to work? And if the Azopt drops and their preservative had caused some toxic reaction seven months ago, could that still be causing him to feel the discomfort? His consultant suggested out that he could have the eye removed to control the pain, but as he has what he feels is some slight, useful vision in that eye, he does not want to take such a drastic and life-changing step.

If the volume retention is moderate, then we have to strengthen your pelvic floor muscle with some exercise and believe me it gives an excellent result and I had, treated so many patients with that exercise. Another possibility is decreased blood concentration of ADH (anti-diuretic hormones) which is, responsible for concentrating the urine and lack of this hormone is responsible for frequent urination.

These symptoms could be due to: So, to reach a diagnosis, you need to undergo few investigations including full blood count, blood sugar, thyroid function test, B12 and folate level, CT or MRI brain, liver and renal function test. There are psychological tests such as MMSE (mini-mental state examination), or Hamilton depression rating scale (to find the level of depression), ADAS - Cog to find the level of cognition.

The timeline for neurodegenerative diseases is different for each disease and also vary considerably in different people, like Alzheimer disease progresses in 5 years to a decade while prion disease progression is very rapid. Similarly, neurodegenerative diseases secondary to medical conditions are reversible or at least stagnant once appropriate treatment is taken.

If the pain is sharp, lancinating and referring to the same side jaw, temple, ear or throat, then this could be from the tooth with the chipped out filling.

If the nerve is involved, a root canal treatment and crown procedure will be done to save that tooth. If the pain is from the gums and is dull in nature, this could be an accidental gum injury due to flossing or there is a chance of the attempted food deposit to get deeply pushed into the gums causing this pain. If this is the case, a deep localized scaling should be performed under local anaesthesia to relieve any deeply wedged food deposit.

Hypothyroidism and high prolactin explain a few symptoms that you are suffering from. So before jumping to conclusion that it is psychological, I would suggest you that further investigation is required such as serum testosterone, serum LH (luteinizing hormone) and FSH (follicle-stimulating hormone). You may also need sonography of testes and visualization of the duct to see if they are blocked or not and also prostate if it is enlarged or not. Most often psychological anejaculation is situational and not permanent or complete, while you mentioned that you never had it. So I recommend that you consult a urologist for your symptoms and get investigated properly to find the cause of your problem. It is a treatable condition and can be treated accordingly.

{"messages": [{"role": "User", "content": "Hi doctor,I have a non-itchy but painful penis rash. I am a 47-year-old unmarried, not-sexually active, uncircumcised male, 5'10\\x80\\x9d, 190 pounds. I have a history of ulcerative colitis (which seems to be hereditary). This was corrected 12 years back when I received a total colectomy and pouch replacement (that is bowel removed, and new bowel constructed out of small intestine). That seems all good. For some time (five years), I have experienced a very slight pain or irritation at the base of the glans of my penis. Friction (eg., masturbation) would make it sore, but it was very slight. Some redness in the skin just below the glans, but not always. Did not even consider this a problem (and it might not be the problem, I am just mentioning it).Six months back the glans of my penis became inflamed. This was the start of my problems. No bumps, no itchiness, no scaling skin. Just redness on the bottom half of the glans, and also the tip. It got very sore. If it was never touched, it does not hurt at all. However, it rubs the underwear during the day, and that can be very painful. Not always, but most of the time. The pain can be excruciating. I want to emphasize that the rash has never been itchy. Urinating causes no pain. I consulted my family physician and he did not know what it was but said he could treat it like a yeast infection. So he prescribed some antifungal cream with 1 % Hydrocortisone (Clotrimaderm) and when that did not do anything, suggested the 1 % HC might be getting in the way, so prescribed straight anti-fungal over the counter anti-fungal cream (all the creams I have used twice a day). No help. The 1 % HC did relieve some (a little) of the pain but did not actually fix anything.Thinking maybe the problem was not fungal, but perhaps bacterial, my doctor then prescribed Polysporin ointment. I quite by accident bought the version of Polysporin with Lidocaine. The Polysporin also did not fix the problem, but the Lidocaine brought some relief! The pain was lessened, but as I said, the problem was not fixed. I used Lidocaine for two weeks before going back to the doctor to let him know the problem remained. He then recommended a urologist, so I got a referral to a urologist. The urologist did not know what it was but suggested two possibilities: go see a dermatologist or get a circumcision. My family doctor did not think the circumcision would help, so he referred me to a dermatologist. The dermatologist said the rash was non-contagious and non-cancerous. He prescribed me four creams which I was to try, in sequence one at a time, for a week at a time, and let him know which helped. They were Ketoderm 2 %, Fucidin 2 %, Noritate 1 %, and Hydroval. I tried each of these as directed. None of these helped. The ones with some HC 1 % relieved some of the pain, but the rash is currently as bad or worse than when the problem started. The dermatologist said there was nothing else he could do, and recommended I get another appointment with a different urologist. The dermatologist did a swab and sent it to the lab, and it came back negative. He also had earlier said it was not an STI.As you can imagine, I am not very encouraged. My doctor does not seem to know what is up, and neither does the urologist or dermatologist. Can you give me some suggestions as to the cause and the remedy for my rash?"}, {"role": "Chatbot", "content": "Hi.

Another cause can be inflammation of the gum flap in that area caused due to food accumulation between the gum flap and the wisdom tooth. For confirmation, a clinical examination and an X-ray is needed. I suggest antibiotics like Augmentin (Amoxicillin and Potassium Clavulanate) and anti-inflammatory painkillers like Ibuprofen can help. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and with their consent take the medicines. Application of numbing gel containing Lignocaine (Lidocaine Topical) over the bump will also help.

Since it is synthesized from a stimulant (tea) it is advised not to combine with other stimulants like caffeine. It can increase anxiety once the effect of caffeine wears off.

If you have chickenpox or herpes zoster virus infection and you are breastfeeding, then your baby does not get infected with the chickenpox virus through your breast milk.

This means that you do have normal TSH with normal T4 and T3. The most common cause is autoimmune thyroid disease, which is confirmed by positive anti-TPO (anti-Thyroid Peroxidase) antibodies. Positive anti-TPO means you have these antibodies in your body which act against the thyroid cells. Most often this is a progressive disease. As of today, we do not have treatment against autoimmunity. Therefore, we replace thyroid hormone in the form of Thyroxine. With TSH near 10 and strongly positive antibodies, I suggest you get your TSH done after 6 weeks. If normal, there is nothing to worry. Apart from the destruction of thyroid cells, anti-TPO antibodies do not cause any other harm. Disease per se is harmless if TSH is kept normal. Keep track of TSH and treat it accordingly.

I have worried a lot (pacing the floor, sleep loss) for past five months, took Paxil, and realized my worry could account for some weight loss. Shortly, after the test, I had the following symptoms:I started having a small patch of 8 to 10 pinpoint sized pink-light red dots under the skin of my left wrist that have been there for two to three weeks.I also had a smooth, flat spot about 3/8 inch in diameter that appeared on the back of my right hand about a week ago, that has now faded to a pinkish brown. I have read about Kaposi sarcoma being a definer of AIDS, but do not understand how that could happen with a non-reactive fourth generation test four months back.Three months back, I had sinus type headaches multiple times that would sometimes be severe. After three rounds of antibiotics and a CT scan two months back that showed shadowing in a sinus, my ENT doctor just told me this week that there is something in my sphenoid sinus.

Antibodies once formed will remain detectable by screening tests.

Is that correct?I am currently taking Gabapentin, Tizanidine, Naproxen, Levothyroxine."}, {"role": "Chatbot", "content": "Hi, Welcome to BayMax forum. You are right. Anti-dsDNA antibodies are specific for SLE (systemic lupus erythematosus), especially if the titers are high. Ankylosing spondylitis does not give you any kind of antibodies. Anti-smith antibodies are the most highly specific antibodies for lupus, but only a small percentage of people with lupus have them. Did you get that test? But it is strange that your ANA (antinuclear antibody) was negative. Anti-dsDNA is a type of ANA. I believe it is a false positive. A normal sedimentation rate essentially rules out inflammatory pathology. Lupus is an inflammatory disease. To begin with, we need to know more about your symptoms. SLE is diagnosed based on the symptoms and signs along with laboratory tests. It is not diagnosed just on the basis of an antibody test. You can get false positive tests (positive test in the absence of disease). So please get back to me with details of your symptoms. Based on the information you gave, I do not think you have lupus. There are no blood tests that can diagnose ankylosing spondylitis (AS). HLA-B27 is more common in people with AS, but it is not diagnostic. AS diagnosis needs clinical and radiological criteria.

Firstly, stop worrying. There is a solution to your problem. It is true that unsterile needles used for tattooing can lead to the spread of certain blood-borne infections. HIV virus is quite unstable outside the human body, so it is less likely for the virus to have been active on the needles, but we cannot rule out the chance of him acquiring the infection. HIV virus does not usually show up on blood tests very soon. The best thing to do is to talk to your doctor about the exposure and your fiance can take post-exposure prophylaxis. Some medicines will be given that will help to prevent infection in people who might have been exposed to the virus. There may be a risk of other blood-borne infections like hepatitis B, hepatitis C, tuberculosis or Staphylococcus aureus. These can be prevented by taking appropriate treatment.

I understand your concern. There is exactly not much research done on how long bacteria or viruses could survive in a liquid lipstick. If you have had a gastrointestinal infection, and if your lipstick came in contact with your saliva, the microbes could have gone into the lipstick. How long they survive in the lipstick, and how fast they multiply, largely depends on what kind of chemicals were used in the making of the lipstick. Moreover, different microbes need different kinds of growth environment, so it is hard to comment on that. I would advise you to avoid using cosmetics when you are sick. Regarding sharing of your lipstick, it is never a great idea to share your cosmetics with others. Cosmetics should be used as personal items, just like you would use your toothbrush. Sharing cosmetics can lead to the spread of skin infections. If you think you have shared cosmetics with someone you think might have some kind of infection, I would advise you to dispose it, and buy something new. I hope this helps.  Take care."}]}

However, the size of the testis does not matter as long as the semen functional tests are normal. Moreover, there are no medicines available to increase the size of a small testis. In your case, the size is just borderline and nothing to worry. I would advise you get a semen analysis done to see the functioning of the testis. Also, the spots that you have mentioned are physiological and represent the oil glands on the genitalia. They do not warrant any treatment. With regards to the use of Chlorobenzene and other oils, they can at times lead to an allergic contact dermatitis. But otherwise, do not affect the testicular size.

The earliest symptom is missing the next expected period. You cannot do anything to stop the pregnancy right now. If she misses her period, she can confirm pregnancy at home by doing a urine pregnancy test. If pregnancy is confirmed, you can consult a gynecologist for abortion through medicines. In case, she becomes pregnant, she will miss her next expected period. Remember one thing, pregnancy is very rare (most unlikely) in the scenario you described, so there is no need to fear. Just wait for her next period and things will become clear by then. "}]}

At a place with bad air pollution, one\\s respiratory mucosa tends to get excoriated and irritated due to the harmful contents in the air. This can make the area supple and raw and more prone to bacteria and viruses in the surroundings. Having removed adenoids does not make your kid very susceptible to respiratory infections although theoretically adenoids are supposed to help contain infection by acting as a portal of immunity for harmful organisms entering through nose and throat. But at two weeks post surgery, the area will still be slightly raw and healing would not be complete. Hence, that can cause more susceptibility to environmental pathogens. I suggest you take a good course of antibiotics post surgery and during the hospital stay. Take a course of antibiotics for the baby with you and start when you feel she is developing an infection during your trip. Take decongestant nasal  .  Avoid areas of frank dust and pollution. Stay away from direct cold winds and Aircon air. If feasible put a face mask for the baby.

But now, even after so many months, I can feel some more (not more than two at a time) pimples. I doubt whether it could be folliculitis. I have not had a haircut since ten months, just because I thought the itching could be contagious. So, I better not go for a haircut and spread it to others. There are two to three bumps on my face as well. One was hurting earlier, but it is all itchy and the other two are only itchy. I would like to state it again that they do not itch all the time and one that aches do not hurt at all the time. Also, I felt a pimple like thing on my butt. It disappeared in a week.

I did not take the drug every day and after roughly two months I quit the drug altogether, the withdrawal, that I did not recognize at the time, kicked in (Extreme tinnitus, sweating, heart racing, heightened anxiety). I went to ENT doctor and she gave me two Dexamethasone injections in 3 days (I think 8 mg). I developed during these 3 days a major loss of short term and then long term memory, trouble finding words, trouble learning in general. The physical symptoms of the steroids and benzo withdrawal went away in 2 weeks. It has now been a month since I feel physically fine, but the cognitive issues persist and they do not get better at all. I have been to a psychiatrist because I felt overwhelmed that Iam not going to be able to finish school in such a state and she gave me Escitalopram thinking it could be psychological, but there is no improvement in cognition after a months use.Does that combination have that drastic side-effects and could it caused a chemical or structural problem in brain?

You have hypertension (high blood pressure), which is out of control occasionally during episodes of anxiety. The baseline BP control is fine. I would suggest adding a new medicine, tablet Concor 2.5 mg (Bisoprolol) once daily at 8 AM. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and take the medicine with consent. Let me encourage you to develop a more healthy lifestyle. One practical suggestion would be to join a good gym and have a trainer. You should start with elliptical trainer and treadmill. You need to change your sedentary lifestyle and that in turn will help you to decrease the number of medicines. Also, having a personal trainer will help you to have a sustainable activity program.
